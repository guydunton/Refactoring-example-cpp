# Refactoring Example C++

This is a worked through example from Martin Fowler's great book on [Refactoring](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html).

As I've gone through the example from the start of the book I've tried to make small changes and add git tags. Each tag represents a part of the example where a single refactoring or change has been made.
